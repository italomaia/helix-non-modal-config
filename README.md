# My Helix Config

I was never a big fan of editors like vim and vi, as you need to remember just too many
commands and build too much muscle memory to be able to use them effectively. Recently
neovim came around, trying to level the field and make the text based experience a bit
friendlier. And now there is (Helix)[https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/].

It fields friendly, adds some neat ideas that remind me of the (howl editor)[https://github.com/howl-editor/howl],
another project I like and kind of did pick my interest.

After giving it a few hours, I can say the experience is interesting and I can see
myself being productive with it, but not how it currently is. It is too bound to
the idea of not moving your hands around, which is not a big deal for me, which
translates into key mappings that few a bit unnatural to my taste.

## The idea

This project is just a place to store the configuration that works for me, and other
people might find interesting or useful. In general, it brings me the following benefits:

- I can just copy paste it, when needed
- allows me to do tasks without changing modes too much
- keymap feels more natural to a GUI user such as myself

If you find this, give it a try. Most keymaps have a description either telling what
they do or why they exist.
